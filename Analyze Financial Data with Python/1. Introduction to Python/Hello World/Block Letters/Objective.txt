INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
Block Letters
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Block Letters

Happy coding!

Tasks
5/5 Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
What we are building in this project:
1.
Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

 SSS   L
S   S  L
S      L
 SSS   L
    S  L
S   S  L
 SSS   LLLLL
Once you are ready, mark this task complete by checking off the box.


Hint
initials.py should use multiple print() statements to output your initials in block letters.

The numbers in the grid are there to help represent the dimensions of each block letter; you shouldn’t include the numbers in your strings.

Setting up:
2.
First, write two comments with:

Your first and last name.
A fun fact about yourself.

Hint
A Python comment starts with a # and continues to the end of the line:

# Sonny Li
# Fun Fact: I played guitar in a band called Attica.
3.
Output your first initial as a block letter. There are a few ways to do this!

Press Save to run your program.


Hint
The program can look like this if your first initial is S:

print("  SSS  ")
print(" S   S ")
print(" S     ")
print("  SSS  ")
print("     S ")
print(" S   S ")
print("  SSS  ")
If you want to use a multi-line string instead, store the string in a variable using triple quote-marks:

name = """ 
  SSS
 S   S 
 S     
  SSS 
     S
 S   S
  SSS  
"""
 
print(name)
4.
Output your second initial as a block letter by adding to the print() statements.

Press Save to run your program.


Hint
The program should look something like this:

print("  SSS   L     ")
print(" S   S  L     ")
print(" S      L     ")
print("  SSS   L     ")
print("     S  L     ")
print(" S   S  L     ")
print("  SSS   LLLLL ")
For multi-line string:

name = """ 
  SSS   L
 S   S  L
 S      L   
  SSS   L
     S  L
 S   S  L
  SSS   LLLLL
"""
 
print(name)
